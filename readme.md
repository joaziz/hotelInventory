## Challenge:

Using the following endpoint : https://api.myjson.com/bins/tl0bp 

Build an application (console or REST API) to allow search in this inventory by any of the following :

- Hotel Name
- Destination [City]
- Price range [ex: $100:$200]
- Date range [ex: 10-10-2020:15-10-2020]

and allow sorting by:

- Hotel Name 
- Price


### Consideration:
- You should consume the api endpoint mention and not use it as internal json file
- You should build this application to work in PHP 7.1 or later, you are free to use any php framework or to build it completely from scratch
- Don't use any database systems or full text search engines like elastic search or solar
- If you put any assumptions for any function which are not clear in the task please mention it on the README file

### Delivery:
- Create public Github repo which contain the final code
- Update your repo README file to have all needed instructions to run the application and unit test, and include some examples
- Unit test should be included
